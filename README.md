## Gerard Morera

I love Ruby. I want to work as a Ruby developer. I have been hitchiking for the past few years doing all kinds of different jobs until I felt a lack of intellectual challenge. At this point I discovered coding and a high intensity new kind of journey started with it. I love building and creating and with coding I have found something that is my passion and that I can get paid for.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Developer

I have a basic understanding and a serious will to deepen my knowledge in OOD, SOLID principles and design patterns. My goal is to produce beautiful code that I can be proud of.
 
- Ruby

This is my favourite language and consequently the one I have spent most of my days studying. I love Ruby because it has a big commitment on Object Orientation, everything is an object and every action is a method call and, unlike other languages, the programmer specifies what needs to be done rather than how to do it. That makes ruby the most elegant and readable language I know. I find it so hard to escape from beauty...

- Rails

This is [Detour](https://github.com/zeus-org/detour-rails), my final project at Makers. We tried to use the rails framework only as a Ruby library to build the app following the best canonical OOD procedures. All the classes are concise and decoupled following the single responsibility principle with tiny interfaces and short, explicit methods.

- Javascript 

I have some comprehension of the main features of this languange and am able to play with some frameworks like Angular and Ionic. [Bowling counter](https://github.com/gerard-morera/bowling-challenge) is one small program I did. I want to learn much more of it together with many different new technologies.

#### Social competencies
Due to the time I have been travelling and the great amount of people I met I have developed strong social skills, which I think make me a (cheerful team player) good team player and a very positive person.

- Catalan: Native.
