## [Gerard Morera](https://github.com/gerard-morera/CV) - Full Stack Web Developer

I am a passionate person, a Web Developer, a traveller, a go player... But, what I love the most from this world is empathy.
After many years of travelling I got into coding and an amazing new jorney started. 

I have been working with Ruby and Javascript for one year and I am really interested in design patterns and any kind of abstractions. I have spent most time of my short career deeping into Object Oriented Design but lately I got very enthusiastic about the functional paradigm.
