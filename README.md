## [Gerard Morera](https://github.com/gerard-morera/CV)

Software developer, Go player, musician, traveller and basically a very passionate person. After many years of studying and travelling I got into coding and a beautiful new journey started.

Lately I am getting much more interested in the functional paradigm, for that reason I have started stuying elixir.
