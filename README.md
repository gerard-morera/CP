## [Gerard Morera](https://github.com/gerard-morera/CV)

I am a passionate person, a web developer, a traveller, a Go player... After many years of travelling I got into coding and an amazing new journey started. 

I have been working with Ruby and Javascript for one year and I am really interested in the best coding practices, design patterns and any kind of abstraction. Most of my career has been spent concentrating on Object Orientated Design, however lately I've become very interested and enthusiastic about functional paradigm.
